The file `System_A_ESSLLI.thy` accompanies the paper Formalizing Henkin-Style Completeness of an Axiomatic System for Propositional Logic (ESSLLI 2020).

The file `System_A.thy` extends the above with binary conjunction and disjunction operators.

The files `System_R.thy` and `System_W.thy` accompany the paper Formalizing Axiomatic Systems for Propositional Logic in Isabelle/HOL (CICM 2021).

The remaining files accompany the paper More Formalized Axiomatic Systems for Propositional Logic in Isabelle/HOL (SLAI 2022).

Except that the files `LT1.thy`, `LT2.thy`, `LT3.thy` and `LT4.thy` are experiments with the system from Jan Lukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski (1930).
